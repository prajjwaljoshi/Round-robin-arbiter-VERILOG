# Round-Robin-Arbiter
# Introduction
This is a Verilog project that implements a Round-Robin Arbiter. The Round-Robin Arbiter is a common hardware component used in digital systems to fairly allocate resources among multiple requestors. It ensures that each requestor gets an equal share of the available resources over time.
Introduction
The Round-Robin Arbiter is designed to solve the problem of resource contention in digital systems. It is often used in scenarios where multiple requestors compete for access to a shared resource, such as a memory controller or a bus. The arbiter provides a fair and deterministic way of granting access to the requestors.

This project provides a Verilog implementation of a Round-Robin Arbiter. The arbiter supports a configurable number of requestors and uses a round-robin scheduling algorithm to grant access to the resources. It ensures that each requestor receives an equal opportunity to access the shared resource, regardless of their priority or timing.

# Implementation Details
The Round-Robin Arbiter is implemented using Verilog, a hardware description language (HDL) commonly used for designing digital systems. The arbiter module consists of a priority encoder, a counter, and a control logic unit.

The priority encoder determines the highest priority requestor among the pending requests. The counter keeps track of the current round-robin position, indicating which requestor will be granted access next. The control logic unit coordinates the operation of the arbiter, enabling or disabling the requestors based on their turn.

The Round-Robin Arbiter module can be easily integrated into larger digital systems by instantiating it and connecting the input request signals and output grant signals to the respective components.

# Usage
To use the Round-Robin Arbiter in your project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository or download the source code.
Include the arbiter module in your Verilog design hierarchy.
Instantiate the arbiter module and connect the input request signals and output grant signals to the appropriate components.
Simulate or synthesize your design using a Verilog simulator or synthesis tool.
